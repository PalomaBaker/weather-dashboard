# WeatherCast
WeatherCast is a web app that allows users to search for a city and view current and future weather conditions for that location. The app displays the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the current weather. The app also presents a 5-day forecast that shows the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

Users can add cities to their search history, and when they click on a previously searched city, the app will display current and future weather conditions for that location. This feature makes it easy for users to keep track of weather conditions for multiple cities.

Our weather dashboard app is designed to be easy to use and provide all the information that users need to plan their activities and stay informed about weather conditions. Whether you're planning a trip or just need to know what to wear, our app has you covered. Try it out today and never be caught off guard by the weather again!
